#
# joyent_base: common ssh configuration options for engineers at Joyent.
#
# Quick-start instructions:
#
# - Review this file.  The comments in this file and the ssh_config(1) manual
#   page should explain what it does.
# - If you already have a $HOME/.ssh/config, append this file to it.  If not,
#   you can copy this file directly to $HOME/.ssh/config.  (Newer versions of
#   OpenSSH also support including a separate file from your main configuration
#   file.)
# - Search below for "USER-SPECIFIC CUSTOMIZATIONS".  Fill out that block with
#   your specific user details and uncomment it.
#
#
# Overview
#
# In general, Joyent engineers may use ssh to connect to a variety of servers,
# including:
#
#   - test machine global zones
#
#   - development zones
#
#   - global zones of production headnodes
#
#   - bastion hosts for other services
#
# Very often, it's convenient to apply some configuration options to a variety
# of hosts whose actual hostnames may have nothing in common (or may not even
# have DNS names).  For example, one usually logs in as "root" for test machine
# global zones, so it's convenient to specify "User root" in the ssh
# configurations for these, but they don't usually have their own DNS names, so
# it may not be obvious how to share configuration.
#
# We accomplish this by defining patterns of hostnames used only in ssh_config.
# For example, a rule like:
#
#     Host *.gz
#         User root
#
# Now we can define blocks for any test machine global zone like:
#
#     Host emy10.gz
#         HostName 172.26.10.4
#
# To ssh to test machine "emy10", we use the hostname "emy10.gz".  That's not a
# real DNS name, but it selects this configuration, which specifies both the IP
# address and the user (by virtue of the "*.gz" configuration block).
#
# We make extensive use of this pattern to define hostnames for test machine
# global zones, dev zones, and production systems.  We define the following
# suffixes:
#
#      *.dev          used for non-global zones used for general development
#      *.gz           used for global zones of development systems
#      *.jpc          used for global zones in JPC (production)
#      *.spc          used for global zones in SPC (production)
#      *.spc_staging  used for global zones in SPC (production)
#

#
# USER-SPECIFIC CUSTOMIZATIONS
# You probably want to fill in the usernames below and uncomment this block.
#
#Host *.dev
#	# This should be the username you typically use for development systems.
#	User alice
#Host *.jpc *.spc bastion-jpc-prod bastion-spc-prod bastion-spc-staging
#	# This should be your username in the Ops LDAP system.
#	User alice
#Host cr.joyent.us
#	#
#	# This should be your cr.joyent.us username (which is generally your
#	# GitHub username).
#	#
#	User alice


#
# COMMON CONFIGURATIONS
#

#
# *.dev: non-global development zones
#
Host *.dev
	#
	# ssh agent forwarding is convenient so that you can authenticate to
	# remote services (e.g., Manta, GitHub) from remote environments without
	# copying private keys to them.  However, it's not secure to do this in
	# untrusted environments.  It's recommended to keep agent forwarding
	# disabled by default, but enable it for specific trusted systems
	# (including dev systems).
	#
	ForwardAgent yes
	#
	# ServerAliveInterval is helpful when traversing NATs or other devices
	# that may drop TCP connections for inactivity.
	#
	ServerAliveInterval 45

#
# *.gz: global zones in (trusted) development environments
#
Host *.gz
	# In dev environments, logins to global zones usually use user "root".
	User root
	# See the note under "*.dev" above.
	ForwardAgent yes
	# See the note under "*.dev" above.
	ServerAliveInterval 45

#
# *.jpc, *.spc, and bastion hosts: Ops-managed production environments in the
# JPC and SPC.
#
Host *.jpc *.spc *.spc_staging bastion-spc-prod bastion-jpc-prod bastion-spc-staging
	#
	# The ControlMaster options are used to persist the ssh connection for
	# these environments to avoid having to re-authenticate for every
	# session.  Care must be taken with these options, precisely because
	# they allow a user of your local system to establish new sessions
	# without re-authenticating.  Remember to disconnect from ssh (and the
	# VPN) when you leave your system unattended.
	#
	ControlMaster auto
	ControlPath "/tmp/ssh-c-%r@%h:%p"
	ControlPersist 300s
	# See the note under "*.dev" above.
	ForwardAgent yes
